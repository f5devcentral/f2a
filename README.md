## Overview
When delivering IT Services, speed is always of paramount concern. If you can respond to changes in market conditions and customer wishes faster than your competitor you have an advantage. If you can change and improve your security posture faster than malicious actors can fabricate new attacks, you are more secure. While speed alone is not a silver bullet, without expedicious time to value the best application features and security solutions are for naught.  

In this repository, we will be iteratively developing the Fragile to Agile story. In addition, we will create IT Service architectures that show the key technical and process components of Agile delivery. And, to make it real, we will reference repositories that demonstrate implementations of the Agile architectures.
## Getting Started
Some reading is warranted to get started with Fragile to Agile. 
There may be additional documents that elaborate on details of the story. If you find additional reading, please send a pull request to update this list.

## Installation
We want to install the desire for Agile, or even better Antifragile, delivery of IT Services. Read the suggestions above. Study the architectures (as they're released and revised). And, [contribute](CONTRIBUTING.md)
## Usage
TBD
## Development
Please read our [contributing expectations](CONTRIBUTING.md) and the [design principles](DESIGNPRINCIPLES.md) that will help this repository grow.

## Metrics of Speed
It is important to be clear what we mean by "speed". We do not mean speed at the expense of exceptional customer experience. We mean that organizations see the following measurable results:
- Deployment frequency is measured in times per day  
How often your company can deploy updates to your IT services
- Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR) is measured in minutes or seconds  
How quickly can you restore full service if a failure occurs
- Mean Time between Failure (MTBF) is measured in weeks or months or years  
How often do failures occur
- Lead Time to Value is measured in hours or days  
How quickly can a new feature or capability be delivered
## Practices of Speed
- Version control of code and configuration
- Deployment automation
- Test automation
- Shift left on security  
[What does this mean]Include security at the beginning of your process
- Loosely coupled architecture
- Pro-active notification
## Use Cases
- Update component to a new version
- Update component configuration to a new version
